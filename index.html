            My name is Giulio Arpaia and some time ago I decided to study Python to become a Back-end Developer. </br>
            Along the way, I am also learning some tip and tricks about HTML and CSS, so be patient if this web  </br>
            is a bit basic.

            I was born in the south of Italy, but I lived a bit here and there: I completed my B.Sc. about Natural</br>
            History in Bologna, I moved to Turin for my M.Sc. in "Evolution of Animal and Human behaviour",</br>
            I went to UK to study English working there for several years and I am now living in Germany.

            In my free time, I love playing board games and sometimes I work as a Game Promoter around Europe:</br>
            I have even worked several times at the "Spiel", the biggest worldwide board game convention, which</br>
            is held every year in October in Essen, Germany.</br>
