            My name is Giulio Arpaia and some time ago I decided to study Python to become a Back-end Developer.
            Along the way, I am also learning some tips and tricks about HTML and CSS, so be patient if this web
            is a bit basic.

            I was born in the south of Italy, but I lived a bit here and there: I completed my B.Sc. about Natural
            History in Bologna, I moved to Turin for my M.Sc. in "Evolution of Animal and Human behaviour",
            I went to UK to study English working there for several years and I am now living in Germany.

            In my free time, I love playing board games and sometimes I work as a Game Promoter around Europe:
            I have even worked several times at the "Spiel", the biggest worldwide board game convention, which
            is held every year in October in Essen, Germany.
